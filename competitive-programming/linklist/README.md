# My Interview Preps
### Competetive Programming
### Arrays

1. Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.
1. Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.
1. Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the nâ€™th node from end of the Linked List.
1. First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line contains length of linked list and next line contains the linked list elements.
1. You have to complete the method which takes 1 argument: the head of the  linked list  .You should not read any input from stdin/console. There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.
1. Given a Linked list with reference to the Node that is to be deleted. (the pointer is not the head or the end of the link list)
1. Given a single linked list and an integer x your task is to complete the function deleteAllOccurances  which deletes all occurences of a key x present in the linked list. The function takes two arguments: the head of the linked list and an integer x. The function should return the head of the modified linked list.
1. Given a linked list,performs the following task a)Remove alternative nodes from second node b)Reverse the removed list. c)Append the removed list at the end.
1. There are two singly linked lists of size N and M in a system. But, due to some programming error the end node of one of the linked list got linked into one of the node of second list, forming a inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.
1. Given n sorted link list, convert into one sorted link list.
1. You are given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove the loop from the linked list, if present.
1. Find the height of a binary tree.
